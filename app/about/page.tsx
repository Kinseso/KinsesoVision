      <h2>Kinseso Secure Evidence Engine (KSEE)</h2>

      <p>This is the core innovation at the heart of KinsesoVision.</p>

      <p>
        The <strong>Kinseso Secure Evidence Engine (KSEE)</strong> provides
        real-time automatic cloud recording for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Dashcams</li>
        <li>CCTV</li>
        <li>Home cameras</li>
        <li>Doorbells</li>
        <li>Phones</li>
        <li>Bodycams</li>
        <li>Vehicle cameras</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Everything streams to the cloud instantly. Even if a thief steals the device
        or a card is damaged, the evidence is already safe.
      </p>

      <h3>AI Event Detection</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Break-ins and vandalism</li>
        <li>Car theft and road incidents</li>
        <li>Assault and medical emergencies</li>
        <li>Abuse in care homes and workplaces</li>
        <li>Domestic disturbance and safety concerns</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>AI Evidence Pack Generation</h3>
      <p>KSEE builds structured evidence packs that can include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Video and snapshots</li>
        <li>Timeline of events</li>
        <li>Location and context</li>
        <li>Detected event types</li>
        <li>Geo-time logs</li>
        <li>Export-ready summaries for insurers or relevant authorities</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Together, KinsesoVision and KSEE form a scalable, commercially focused
        platform that combines safety, services, analytics and community in a single
        intelligent ecosystem.
